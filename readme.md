We designed a sensor node that can monitor some important body parameters as well as indoor room parameters. Body parameters included pulse rate and body temperature. Room parameters included room temperature, humidity, smoke level and gas leakage detection. A mobile app was designed to monitor the sensor data. The mobile app displayed alert notifications if the sensor readings are above the threshold range. The system was cost-effective and portable.
